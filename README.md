I recently developed a tribute of the game Double Dragon 3 - The Rosetta Stone in C++ with SDL for the master Video Game Design and Development in the Univercidad Politecnica de Catalu√±a.

In this game you can play in the level 3 of the original game, and figth with a type of the originals enemis. 

You can choise between Billy or Jimmy to play, or you can play with a friend and use both. 
To win you must kill a number of enemis, these enemies follow you. Only a few enemies can attack you in the same time. 
You lose the game if the timer is ended, or you use all the coind and die.

To play the game you must use the following keys:

Player1: Move to up, down, left, rigth with W, S, A and D. Jump with G, kick with h and punch with F.

Player2: Move to up, down, left, rigth with the movements keys. Jump with O, kick with P and punch with I. The start button is the K.

In order to develop all this tribute game, I use a modular programming technique. You can see the code and test the game in [GitHub](https://github.com/estebanarrua/Tribute-DoubleDragon3) and a video demostation from [Youtube](https://youtu.be/nI-Og8l2CT4).

Also you can download the release version in this [page](https://github.com/estebanarrua/Tribute-DoubleDragon3/releases).
